A racing game taking place in ancient egypt, where you drive a hovercraft in the blazing time-attack mode or the exiting survival-adventure mode!

## Time-Attack Mode
Race for the best time against your own ghost or a preset difficulty.

### Ghosts
Your gameplay is always recorded locally. If you beat your own highscore, your ghost will be overwritten.  
If you try to play agaisn't your own ghost but have not recorded one, no ghost will spawn.

### Fuel
In time-attack, you have a fuel counter ticking down. If it reaches zero, your lose! You get fuel for passing checkpoints.

### Pure skill
The time-attack mode has no powerups or shooting, only your racing skill counts!   

## Adventure Mode
Explore the map at your own pace. In the adventure mode you have a health bar, you take damage from crashing and driving on sand!  
Collect coins and powerups, shoot destructible pillars on the road and find hidden corridors in the pyramid.

## Shop & Settings
Spend your hard earned cash in the shop to unlock upgrades. You can upgrade things like speed boost duration, max health and more.  
To unlock upgrades you need **special coins** which you can find at hidden locations in the adventure mode.  
  
The settings menu lets you customize your HUD, change the volume and the color if your ship.
